# 🍫 Reimagined KitKat Website – A Playful & Immersive Web Experience

🚀 A creative and interactive redesign of the KitKat website, bringing together chocolates, nearby KitKat stores, ice creams, and biscuits in a visually engaging format. This project was built as part of the Reimagine Web hackathon by Sheryians, focusing on immersive web experiences with smooth animations and seamless navigation.

# 🎨 Why Reimagine KitKat?
KitKat is more than just a chocolate bar—it's an emotion! Our goal was to capture the essence of the brand and elevate the digital experience by:

Showcasing KitKat chocolates in an interactive and engaging way

Helping users find shops near their location that sell KitKat products

Expanding the product range to include ice creams and biscuits

Creating a visually rich, playful, and smooth user journey

# 🔥 Tech Stack & Tools
We built this project using a combination of modern front-end technologies to ensure a highly animated, smooth, and interactive experience:

# Technology	Purpose
HTML, CSS, JavaScript	Core structure and styling
GSAP + ScrollTrigger	Advanced animations and scroll-based interactions
Locomotive Scroll	Smooth scrolling effects for an immersive feel
Custom Animations	Unique interactions to enhance user engagement
Note: Unlike our previous project (Gucci website), we did not use Swiper.js in this one, as the design focused more on custom scroll-based interactions rather than sliders.

# 🎯 Key Features
